# Colorama Development

Help and fixes are welcome!

Although Colorama has no requirements other than the Python standard library,
development requires some Python packages, which are captured in
requirements-dev.txt.

Throughout, if you're on a Mac, you can probably do something similar to the
Linux instructions. Either use the makefile directly, or look in it to see
what commands it executes, and manually execute something similar. PRs to
automate for Mac appreciated! Especially if they just made the existing Linux
Makefile targets work on Mac too.

## Makefile and PowerShell scripts

Some common commands are captured as Linux makefile targets (which could
perhaps be coaxed into running on OSX in Bash), and as Windows PowerShell
scripts.

| Task                            | Linux               | Windows              |
|---------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Create & populate virtualenv.   | `make bootstrap`    | `.\bootstrap.ps1`    |
| Run tests.                      | `make test`         | `.\test.ps1`         |
| Build a wheel.                  | `make build`        | `.\build.ps1`        |
| Test the wheel.                 | `make test-release` | `.\test-release.ps1` |
| Release the wheel on PyPI       | `make release`      | `.\release.ps1`      |
| Clean generated files & builds. | `make clean`        | `.\clean.ps1`        |

The Makefile is self-documenting, so 'make' with no args will describe each
target.

## Release checklist

1. Check the CHANGELOG is updated with everything since the last release.
2. Remove the '-pre' suffix from `__version__` in `colorama/__init.py__.py`.
3. Run the tests locally on your preferred OS, just to save you from doing
   the following time-consuming steps while there are still obvious problems
   in the code:

   * Windows: `./test.ps1`
   * Linux: `make test`

4. Verify you're all committed, merged to master, and pushed to origin (This
   triggers a Travis build, which we'll check later on)

5. Build the distributables (sdist and wheel), on either OS:

    * Windows: `.\build.ps1`
    * Linux: `make build`

6. Test the distributables on both OS. Whichever one you do 2nd will get an
   HTTP 400 response on uploading to test.pypi.org, but outputs a message
   saying this is expected and carries on:

   * Windows: `./clean.ps1 && .\bootstrap.ps1 && .\build.ps1 &&
     .\test-release.ps1`
   * Linux: `make clean bootstrap build test-release`

    (This currently only tests the wheel, but
    [should soon test the sdist too](https://github.com/tartley/colorama/issues/286).)

7. Check the [Travis builds](https://travis-ci.org/github/tartley/colorama)
   are complete and all passing. (This currently only tests on Linux, but
   [should soon run on Windows too](https://github.com/tartley/colorama/issues/283).)

8. Upload the distributables to PyPI:

   * On Windows: `.\release.ps1`
   * On Linux: `make release`

   This [should soon tag the release for you](https://github.com/tartley/colorama/issues/282). Until then:

9. Tag the current commit with the `__version__` from `colorama/__init__.py`.
   We should start using
   [annotated tags for releases](https://www.tartley.com/posts/til-git-annotated-tags/), so:

       git tag -a -m "" $version
       git push --follow-tags

10. Bump the version number in `colorama/__init__.py`, and add the '-pre'
    suffix again, ready for the next release. Commit and push this (directly to
    master is fine.)
